## Infrastructure Layout

We leverage Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and state management. By using S3 to store Terraform state and DynamoDB for state locking, we ensure no accidental overwrites and consistent environment builds.

### Networking (VPC Module)

- Custom VPC with 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR.
- Multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
- Public/Private subnets, NAT/Internet gateways.
- VPC Peering for extended network reach and integration with other environments.

### Compute (EC2 Module)

- Private EC2 instances running Ralph, fronted by Nginx and orchestrated via Docker Compose.
- Public-facing bastion hosts enabling secure remote access.
- Strict security groups and t3.medium instances balancing cost and performance.

### Database (RDS Module)

- MySQL 5.7 RDS instance for Ralph's backend data.
- Redis (ElastiCache) for caching.
- Private subnet placement for security.
- Automated backups, maintenance tasks, and a db.t3.micro instance size for budget adherence.

### Load Balancing (ALB Module)

- Application Load Balancer routes traffic to Ralph's Nginx frontends.
- Health checks against /login/ (Ralph) and /metrics/ (cAdvisor and Node Exporter).
- HTTP listeners on 80, 8080, and 9100.

## Docker Setup

All application services run in Docker containers:

- Web (Ralph): Django-based Ralph application (port 8000).
- Nginx: Reverse proxy on port 80, serving static files and directing traffic to Ralph.
- RDS & Redis: Externalized data services.
- cAdvisor & Node Exporter: Container-level and node-level monitoring tools feeding into Prometheus/Grafana (maintained by my teammate Carl).

## CI/CD & Automation

![](readme-images/stages-cicd.png)

I've built a baseline Jenkins pipeline designed for smooth, repeatable deployments:

- Jenkins Manager: Orchestrates build/test/deploy using code from GitHub.
- Jenkins Builder Node: Runs Terraform and Docker commands, ensuring consistent, locked state with S3 & DynamoDB.
- Security Scans: Integrated at the image build stage using Trivy.
- No-Interruption Updates: The pipeline updates infrastructure and code without compromising uptime. Using Terraform's remote state and locking, my team and I can safely push changes without stepping on each other's toes.

### Some Jenkinsfile Highlights

- Infrastructure provisioning via Terraform with terraform init/plan/apply steps.
- Automatic verification of EC2 provisioning (e.g., checking if Docker and Node Exporter are active).
- Docker image build and push to Docker Hub.
- Security scans with Trivy.
- Automated Ralph deployment and migrations, idempotently ensuring the latest code is always running.

From my perspective, I'm proud of the baseline pipeline because it's an MVP that can easily evolve. I used S3-backed state and DynamoDB locks so that incremental changes to the environment don't cause conflicts or accidental resource recreation.

### Optimizations & Road map:

1. Selective Deployments: Implementing logic to only run Terraform apply or Docker builds if certain files changed, speeding up overall runs.
2. Caching Docker Layers: Configuring a build cache to reduce image rebuild time for unchanged components.
3. Parallel Testing & Scanning: Splitting out security scans and tests into parallel stages for faster feedback.
4. Dynamic Environment Naming: Tag-based filtering in Terraform to ensure that test or dev environments are clearly separated, preventing naming conflicts.
5. Immutable Artifacts: Storing versioned Docker images and Terraform plans, ensuring rollbacks are simpler and more reliable.

### Performance Optimization

#### Caching Strategy

- Redis cache hit ratio monitoring
- Cache warming procedures for cold starts
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Connection pooling configuration

#### Query Optimization

- Regular database index maintenance
- Slow query analysis and optimization
- Query caching implementation
- Database parameter group tuning

#### Environmental Impact

- Green Computing Initiatives
- Carbon footprint monitoring using AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool
- Optimization for energy-efficient instance types
- Automated resource scheduling for non-production environments
- Regular sustainability impact assessments

## Lessons Learned & Common Issues

- Terraform state locking: Without an S3 backend and DynamoDB lock table, subsequent builds risked causing resource re-creation. Now, only one Terraform job runs at a time, preserving infrastructure integrity.
- Slower security scans: Trivy scans initially slowed our pipeline. We introduced caching directories and refined the severity levels to focus on critical issues first, reducing build times.
- Idempotent deployments: Ensuring that running the pipeline twice wouldn't break anything was tricky. Using built-in checks and "already running" logic in our Docker Compose deployments helped us achieve safer redeploys.
- Stateful services: Managing database and caching layers in private subnets ensured data integrity but required careful planning. Our approach? Automated backups and Terraform variables that handle credentials securely.

## Monitoring & Observability

Early in the project, we recognized the importance of a robust, layered monitoring approach. Thanks to our collective work, our monitoring stack provides real-time insights and historical context, ensuring that everyone on the team—developers, ops, and business stakeholders—can trust the environment's stability and performance.

### Layered Monitoring Architecture

Our observability strategy follows a layered model, ensuring each component has a clear role:

#### Data Sources Layer:

- Node Exporter: Collects system-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk) every few seconds, providing the fundamental health indicators of our infrastructure.
- cAdvisor: Gathers container-level metrics, giving us deep visibility into how Ralph and its supporting services behave at the container level.
- Prometheus: Central metric store and time-series database, scraping metrics regularly and making them queryable for our alerts and dashboards.
- Pushgateway: Bridges ephemeral or batch jobs with Prometheus, ensuring short-lived processes still provide actionable metrics.
- Log Files: Raw application logs and infrastructure logs feed into analytics and alerting pipelines.

#### Orchestration Layer (Workflow Coordinator)

Acting as the conductor, the workflow coordinator routes metrics and logs from data sources to processing layers. It also handles error recovery, ensuring a misbehaving component doesn't stall the entire pipeline. This orchestration lets us define run intervals (e.g., every 15s for Node Exporter, every 5m for more complex analytics), making sure our data is always fresh but not overwhelming.

#### Processing Layer:

- Log Analytics: Ingest raw logs, filter noise, and categorize them for easier downstream consumption.
- Monitoring: Convert raw metrics into actionable insights, pre-processing data for quick consumption by dashboards or alerts.
- Analytics (Including ML Services): We leverage ML-based services to detect patterns, anomalies, or predictive indicators. For example, every 5 minutes, Prometheus queries historical data, and our ML services process these metrics, pushing predictions back into the pipeline.
- Reporting: Summarizes metrics, anomalies, and trends into digestible reports stored locally and in S3 for long-term archival.

#### Storage Layer

Reports and historical data are saved both locally and in Amazon S3. This ensures we have persistent, durable storage of logs, metrics, and analytics results, crucial for audits, capacity planning, and long-term trend analysis.

### Continuous & On-Demand Insights

The diagrams we created show the cadence of metric collection and alert evaluations. For instance:

#### Continuous Collection & Evaluation

Node Exporter and cAdvisor feed Prometheus continuously (every 15 seconds for system metrics), ensuring near-real-time visibility. Prometheus, in turn, applies alerting rules continuously. If thresholds are crossed, it communicates with Alertmanager to generate alerts that route to the right team members.

#### Periodic Analysis & Predictions

Every 5 minutes, Prometheus queries historical data, and our ML services crunch these numbers to identify patterns or predict potential issues. These predictions flow into the Pushgateway, and then Prometheus picks them back up for evaluation. This creates a feedback loop that doesn't just tell us what's happening now, but what might happen next.

#### On-Demand Queries & Visualization

Grafana allows anyone to run ad-hoc queries (PromQL) against Prometheus. This means on-demand insights into system performance, historical data comparisons, and trend analyses are just a dashboard away. Combined with the ML predictions and alerts, Grafana dashboards provide an interactive, data-rich environment for troubleshooting and capacity planning.
