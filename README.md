## Infrastructure Layout

We leverage **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning and state management. By using **S3** to store Terraform state and **DynamoDB** for state locking, we ensure no accidental overwrites and consistent environment builds.

### Networking (VPC Module)

- Custom VPC with `10.0.0.0/16` CIDR.
- Multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
- Public/Private subnets, NAT/Internet gateways.
- VPC Peering for extended network reach and integration with other environments.

### Compute (EC2 Module)

- Private EC2 instances running Ralph, fronted by Nginx and orchestrated via Docker Compose.
- Public-facing bastion hosts enabling secure remote access.
- Strict security groups and `t3.medium` instances balancing cost and performance.

### Database (RDS Module)

- MySQL 5.7 RDS instance for Ralph's backend data.
- Redis (ElastiCache) for caching.
- Private subnet placement for security.
- Automated backups, maintenance tasks, and a `db.t3.micro` instance size for budget adherence.

### Load Balancing (ALB Module)

- Application Load Balancer routes traffic to Ralph's Nginx frontends.
- Health checks against `/login/` (Ralph) and `/metrics/` (cAdvisor and Node Exporter).
- HTTP listeners on 80, 8080, and 9100.

## Docker Setup

All application services run in Docker containers:

- **Web (Ralph):** Django-based Ralph application (port 8000).
- **Nginx:** Reverse proxy on port 80, serving static files and directing traffic to Ralph.
- **RDS & Redis:** Externalized data services.
- **cAdvisor & Node Exporter:** Container-level and node-level monitoring tools feeding into Prometheus/Grafana (maintained by my teammate Carl).

## CI/CD & Automation

![](readme-images/stages-cicd.png)

I've built a baseline Jenkins pipeline designed for smooth, repeatable deployments:

- **Jenkins Manager:** Orchestrates build/test/deploy using code from GitHub.
- **Jenkins Builder Node:** Runs Terraform and Docker commands, ensuring consistent, locked state with S3 & DynamoDB.
- **Security Scans:** Integrated at the image build stage using Trivy.
- **No-Interruption Updates:** The pipeline updates infrastructure and code without compromising uptime. Using Terraform's remote state and locking, my team and I can safely push changes without stepping on each other's toes.

### Some Jenkinsfile Highlights

- **Infrastructure provisioning** via Terraform with `terraform init/plan/apply` steps.
- **Automatic verification** of EC2 provisioning (e.g., checking if Docker and Node Exporter are active).
- **Docker image build** and push to Docker Hub.
- **Security scans** with Trivy.
- **Automated Ralph deployment** and migrations, ensuring the latest code is always running.

From my perspective, I'm proud of the baseline pipeline because it's an MVP that can easily evolve. I used S3-backed state and DynamoDB locks so that incremental changes to the environment don't cause conflicts or accidental resource recreation.

### Optimizations & Road map:

1. **Selective Deployments:** Implementing logic to only run Terraform apply or Docker builds if certain files changed, speeding up overall runs.
2. **Caching Docker Layers:** Configuring a build cache to reduce image rebuild time for unchanged components.
3. **Parallel Testing & Scanning:** Splitting out security scans and tests into parallel stages for faster feedback.
4. **Dynamic Environment Naming:** Tag-based filtering in Terraform to ensure that test or dev environments are clearly separated, preventing naming conflicts.
5. **Immutable Artifacts:** Storing versioned Docker images and Terraform plans, ensuring rollbacks are simpler and more reliable.

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

- Redis cache hit ratio monitoring
- Cache warming procedures for cold starts
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Connection pooling configuration

### Query Optimization

- Regular database index maintenance
- Slow query analysis and optimization
- Query caching implementation
- Database parameter group tuning

### Environmental Impact

- Green Computing Initiatives
- Carbon footprint monitoring using AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool
- Optimization for energy-efficient instance types
- Automated resource scheduling for non-production environments
- Regular sustainability impact assessments

## Lessons Learned & Common Issues

- **Terraform state locking:** Without an S3 backend and DynamoDB lock table, subsequent builds risked causing resource re-creation. Now, only one Terraform job runs at a time, preserving infrastructure integrity.
- **Slower security scans:** Trivy scans initially slowed our pipeline. We introduced caching directories and refined severity levels to focus on critical issues first, reducing build times.
- **Idempotent deployments:** Ensuring that running the pipeline twice wouldn't break anything was tricky. Using built-in checks and ‚Äúalready running‚Äù logic in our Docker Compose deployments helped us achieve safer redeploys.
- **Stateful services:** Managing database and caching layers in private subnets ensured data integrity but required careful planning. Our approach? Automated backups and Terraform variables that handle credentials securely.

## Monitoring & Observability

Early in the project, we recognized the importance of a strong, layered monitoring approach. Thanks to our collective work, our monitoring stack provides real-time insights and historical context, ensuring that everyone on the team‚Äîdevelopers, ops, and business stakeholders‚Äîcan trust the environment's stability and performance.

### Layered Monitoring Architecture

Our observability strategy follows a layered model, ensuring each component has a clear role:

#### Data Sources Layer

- **Node Exporter:** Collects system-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk) every few seconds.
- **cAdvisor:** Gathers container-level metrics for deeper visibility into Ralph‚Äôs containers.
- **Prometheus:** Central metric store and time-series database, scraping metrics regularly.
- **Pushgateway:** Bridges ephemeral or batch jobs with Prometheus.
- **Log Files:** Raw application logs for analytics and alerting.

#### Orchestration Layer (Workflow Coordinator)

Acts as the conductor, routing metrics/logs from data sources to processing layers. Also handles error recovery, ensuring a misbehaving component doesn't stall the entire pipeline.

#### Processing Layer

- **Log Analytics:** Ingest raw logs, filter noise, and categorize them.
- **Monitoring:** Converts raw metrics into actionable insights, pre-processing data for quicker dashboard consumption.
- **Analytics (ML Services):** Detects patterns, anomalies, or predictive indicators.
- **Reporting:** Summarizes metrics, anomalies, and trends into digestible reports stored locally and in S3.

#### Storage Layer

Reports and historical data are saved both locally and in **Amazon S3**, giving us durable storage for audits, capacity planning, and long-term trend analysis.

### Continuous & On-Demand Insights

The diagrams we created show the cadence of metric collection and alert evaluations. For instance:

- **Continuous Collection & Evaluation:** Node Exporter and cAdvisor feed Prometheus every 15 seconds, and Prometheus applies alerting rules continuously.
- **Periodic Analysis & Predictions:** Every 5 minutes, Prometheus queries historical data, and our ML services run predictive analytics.
- **On-Demand Queries & Visualization:** Grafana allows on-demand PromQL queries for debugging, historical comparisons, and capacity planning.

## Conclusion

In this deployment of Ralph, we've demonstrated how great infrastructure, thoughtful automation, and a layered observability strategy can create a stable, scalable, and secure environment.
